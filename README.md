# ECE-369-ClickerApp
This is the Repository for our ECE 369 project that we will be making as a semester long project for Umass Dartmouths ECE 369 Computer Networks Class


Install Directions (Win10):
Download x64 installer (x32 is dead, get over it) from website
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Installer default settings:
- Default host
- Stable toolchain
- Default profile
- Yes PATH variable

How to compile your first program:
Download main.rs from project github: 
https://github.com/lukeGumd/ECE-369-ClickerApp
Open cmd prompt
> rustc main.rs
This produces a .exe and .pdb file.
> main.exe
program go! EZPZ.

If nothing happens, try:
> rustc --version
If there is an error, the cmd PATH settings are wrong.
You can still run the main rust executable from
> C:\Users\yournamehere\.cargo\bin
But try to fix the PATH issue. Pic related.
